    "prompt": "A candid, documentary-style photograph of a diverse adult patient (age 35-65) standing at a local pharmacy counter, holding a small paper prescription medication bag with both hands. The patient displays a gentle, relieved smile and relaxed posture, capturing the moment anxiety lifts. A warm, softly lit environment with natural window light and subtle golden tones fills the scene, avoiding sterile clinical vibes. In the background, a friendly pharmacist (mid-40s, approachable, professional attire) stands behind the counter, making eye contact or offering a supportive gesture, highlighting authentic human connection. The pharmacy space feels lived-in and welcoming, with Care Neutral grays and hints of blue naturally present in decor or clothing. Focus on real relief and trust, with gentle depth of field and generous negative space for a calm, approachable mood. No screens, text, or overtly staged poses—just genuine, empathetic healthcare resolution.",
